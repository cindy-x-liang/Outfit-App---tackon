##A detailed run down

###Welcome Page
Upon first downloading the app, users will be greeted with a welcome page that allows them to input their name and read brief instruction on how to use the app. Once entering the app again the page will not appear.

##Main Page
The main page welcomes the user and prompts them to enter their zipcode to get their location's weather data. By entering the zipcode, the app will call the weather URL to determine what type of outfit the user should wear.
